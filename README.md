# Reddit Scraper
Hello there, I have never scraped Reddit before.
I was interested to see how the praw library
works with Reddit. In the reddit.py file, I am
simply grabbing the top 5 posts (sorted by hot) 
of any subreddit and looking at the statistics.
Some of the statistics include: upvote count, 
comment count, and top comment statistics.

Hopefully, I will build out a bot to comment in 
my favorite subreddits in the near future.
